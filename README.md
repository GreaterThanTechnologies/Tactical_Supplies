# Tactical

Welcome to the Tactical web application! This app was created using Ruby on Rails. 
It is an interface for tactical store owners. While useful for owners, it
can be used for other business owners who carry and track inventory if 
code is adapted properly. In this current iteration, the User holds an 
administrator role and may create products, and supplies. A login is required and 
OmniAuth Google is utilized to facilitate this, in addition to a site-based 
signup/login.
